videolayer
==========

VideoLayer files, free to get and improve

In this directory:
- videolayer.js (the non-minified file)
- videolayer.css
- the videolayer font

- an example HTML file that uses the plugin
- the demo videos and captions from the site, renamed to make use of the plugin as easy as possible (just paste the code
from the site, you don't have to change the sources).
